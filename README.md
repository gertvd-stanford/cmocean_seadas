cmocean colormaps for SeaDAS 7 and SeaDAS 8

Kristen Thyng et al. created more user-friendly oceanographic color palettes. For more info see her GitHub site: https://github.com/matplotlib/cmocean

I converted the color palettes into SeaDAS cpd format.  These color palette definition files will probably work with BEAM or SNAP as well since SeaDAS is based on it.

Installation:  
SeaDAS 7 (BEAM based): Copy the cpd files of interest to your ~/.seadas/beam-ui/auxdata/color-palettes directory.  
SeaDAS 8 (SNAP based): Copy the cpd files of interest to your ~/.seadas8/auxdata/color_palettes directory.  
Restart SeaDAS and then they should be present.
