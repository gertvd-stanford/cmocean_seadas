cmocean colormaps for SeaDAS 7

Kristen Thyng et al. created more user-friendly oceanographic color palettes. For more info see her GitHub site: https://github.com/matplotlib/cmocean

I converted the color palettes into SeaDAS cpd format.  These color palette definition files will probably work with BEAM or SNAP as well since SeaDAS is based on it.

Installation:

Copy the cpd files of interest to the ~/.seadas/beam-ui/auxdata/color-palettes directory. 
Restart SeaDAS and then they should be present.
